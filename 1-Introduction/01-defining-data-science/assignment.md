# Assignment: Data Science Scenarios

In this first assignment, we ask you to think about some real-life process or problem in different problem domains, and how you can improve it using the Data Science process. Think about the following:

1. Which data can you collect?
1. How would you collect it?
1. How would you store the data? How large the data is likely to be?
1. Which insights you might be able to get from this data? Which decisions we would be able to take based on the data?

Try to think about 3 different problems/processes and describe each of the points above for each problem domain.

Here are some of the problem domains and problems that can get you started thinking:

1. How can you use data to improve education process for children in schools?
1. How can you use data to control vaccination during the pandemic?
1. How can you use data to make sure you are being productive at work?
## Instructions

Fill in the following table (substitute suggested problem domains for your own ones if needed):

| Problem Domain | Problem | Which data to collect | How to store the data | Which insights/decisions we can make | 
|----------------|---------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Education |improving the education process for children in schools | children attendance reports/grades/test scores - teachers qualifications |relational database in schools/educational database |relationship between a student's attendance and grades - relationship/correlation between a teacher's qualification - helps in dentifying students who are struggling and needs additional support |
| Vaccination |controling vaccination during the pandemic | number of vaccinated people - number of programs for awarness about vaccination - number of unvaccinated people - number of medical staff - number of vaccinations available |relational database (SQL) in hospitals/healthcare systems/secure government databases| correlation between # of vaccinated people and # of vaccinations available - relationship between # of programs for awarness about vaccination and # of unvaccinated people - can help ensure equitable access|
| Productivity | make sure employees are being productive at work | # of tasks achieved - how many times a person leaves hes/her desktop - employees communication data - employees feedback |relational database (SQL) in company's database|relationship between # of tasks achieved and how many times a person leaves hes/her desktop - can reveal collaboration patterns |

## Rubric

Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement
--- | --- | -- |
One was able to identify reasonable data sources, ways of storing data and possible decisions/insights for all problem domains | Some of the aspects of the solution are not detailed, data storage is not discussed, at least 2 problem domains are described | Only parts of the data solution are described, only one problem domain is considered.
