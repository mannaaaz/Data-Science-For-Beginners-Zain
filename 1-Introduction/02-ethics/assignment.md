## Write A Data Ethics Case Study

## Instructions

You've learned about various [Data Ethics Challenges](README.md#2-ethics-challenges) and seen some examples of [Case Studies](README.md#3-case-studies) reflecting data ethics challenges in real-world contexts.

In this assignment, you'll write your own case study reflecting a data ethics challenge from your own experience, or from a relevant real-world context you are familiar with. Just follow these steps:

1. `Pick a Data Ethics Challenge`. Look at [the lesson examples](README.md#2-ethics-challenges) or explore online examples like [the Deon Checklist](https://deon.drivendata.org/examples/) to get inspiration.

2. `Describe a Real World Example`. Think about a situation you have heard of (headlines, research study etc.) or experienced (local community), where this specific challenge occurred. Think about the data ethics questions related to the challenge - and discuss the potential harms or unintended consequences that arise because of this issue. Bonus points: think about potential solutions or processes that may be applied here to help eliminate or mitigate the adverse impact of this challenge.

3. `Provide a Related Resources list`. Share one or more resources (links to an article, a personal blog post or image, online research paper etc.) to prove this was a real-world occurrence. Bonus points: share resources that also showcase the potential harms & consequences from the incident, or highlight positive steps taken to prevent its recurrence.

## CADAVERS IN CAR SAFETY RESEARCH - A Data Ethics Case Study

### Data Ethics Challange

Informed Consent and Free Choice. 

### Real World Example

"In 1993, it was widely disclosed that research engineers at Heidelberg University in Germany had used 200 adult and child cadavers in simulated car crash tests. The researchers argued that the use of human cadavers was necessary to study the actual effects of these crashes on the body. They insisted that the research would save lives because it would help engineers design safer cars."

#### Data Ethics Questions Related to the Challenge
  1- Did the researchers obtain consent from the individuals before using their bodies for experiments after death?
  
  2- Will such experiments affect the realtives of the deceased individuals emotionally?

  3- Why would using real dead bodies of people be more beneficial than using manikins or dolls?


#### Potential Harms or Unintended Consequences 
  1- Loss of dead bodies for the sake of experiments. 

  2- Severe emotional affect on deceased's reltives. 

  3- Lack of consent. 

#### Potential Solutions or Processes
  1- Prior Informed Consent. 
  
  2- Transparency.

Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement
--- | --- | -- |
One or more data ethics challenges are identified. <br/> <br/> The case study clearly describes a real-world incident reflecting that challenge, and highlights undesirable consequences or harms it caused. <br/><br/> There is at least one linked resource to prove this occurred. | One data ethics challenge is identified. <br/><br/> At least one relevant harm or consequence is discussed briefly. <br/><br/> However discussion is limited or lacks proof of real-world occurence. | A data challenge is identified. <br/><br/> However the description or resources do not adequately reflect the challenge or prove it's real-world occurence. |
